# Archive Directory

This directory contains obsolete or legacy files that are no longer actively used
in the project but are preserved for historical reference and comparison purposes.

## Contents

### `enhanced-backup/`

Backup copies of the enhanced implementation files before refactoring or updates.
These serve as reference for reverting changes if needed.

### `from_old_bmm/`

TypeScript files generated from an older, less information-rich BMM variant.
These are kept for comparison purposes. See `from_old_bmm/README.md` for more
details about their origin.

### `specifications-ITS-BMM/`

Empty directory that was previously used for BMM specifications. The BMM files
are now downloaded dynamically as needed by the generator scripts.

## Note

Files in this archive are not maintained and may not be compatible with the
current version of the library. They should not be used for development.
